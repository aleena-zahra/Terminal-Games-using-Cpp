# Terminal-Games-using-Cpp
This repository contains simple C++ programs for different games I made during my first semester course CS1002 Programming Fundamentals

# 1. Guess the Numbers Game

#### Description:
- A simple console-based game where the user guesses three numbers.
- The program generates three random numbers, and the user needs to guess them in the correct order.
- The game provides feedback on the correctness of the guesses.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter three different numbers as your guesses, each between 0 and 9 when prompted.
3. The program will provide feedback on the correctness and order of your guesses.
   

### 2. Higher or Lower Game

#### Description:
- A console-based game where the user predicts if the second randomly generated number is higher or lower than the first number.
- The program generates two random numbers between 1 and 20.
- The user inputs 'H' for higher or 'L' for lower, and the program provides feedback on the correctness of the prediction.
  
## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. The first number is displayed.
3. Enter 'H' if you think the second number is higher, or 'L' if you think it's lower.
4. The program will inform you if your guess is correct.

### 3. Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

#### Description:
- Classic rock, paper, scissors game against the computer.
- The computer randomly selects rock (R), paper (P), or scissors (S).
- The user inputs their choice, and the program determines the winner.

## How to Play
1. Run the program.
2. Enter 'R' for Rock, 'P' for Paper, or 'S' for Scissors.
3. The program will reveal the computer's choice and determine the winner.

### Note:
- These programs are designed for educational purposes and to provide a hands-on understanding of basic C++ concepts.
- Feel free to explore, modify, and learn from the source code.
